# Papa John's HEATWIN Checker
This is a simple "project" which checks the current validity of the "HEATWIN" discount code on the Papa John's website. (Credit to https://betsapi.com/ for supplying the latest match information.)

## Context
Papa John's provides a discount code (HEATWIN) which deducts 50% off of your order, but the code is only valid the day after the Miami Heat wins a game. In addition, it only applies to customers in South Florida.

### Disclaimer
I have a knack for creating projects that are very niche and almost useless, but I'm still educating myself through doing so. There is probably a better way of checking if the code is valid, but I haven't determined how, yet. Sure, one could simply visit their website, type in the discount code, and click "Apply" to check if it's currently valid; but that's not as fun!
